**Based On:** `Omniverse Kit SDK 106.0`

## Overview

The USD Viewer Messaging Extension Template is specifically designed for the USD Viewer Application, a Viewport-only application that cleanly displays USD content with in-scene functionality. This messaging extension allows remote communication with the underlying Kit application to perform actions typically driven by in-app UI and menus found in other applications.

**:warning: Important:** While this extension exists alongside general extension templates, it is specifically tailored for the USD Viewer Application.

### Use Cases

This messaging extension is particularly useful for:

- Remotely loading scenes in the USD Viewer Application.
- Managing the state for selecting objects within the scene.
- Performing actions without traditional in-app UI and menus.

### Key Features

- Remote communication with the Kit application.
- Scene loading capabilities.
- State management for object selection within the USD Viewer.

## Usage

This extension is automatically created and configured when you generate a new application based on the [USD Viewer Template Application](../../apps/usd_viewer/README.md).

This extension serves as an example for developers to understand how remote communication and scene management can be implemented in applications using the Kit SDK.
